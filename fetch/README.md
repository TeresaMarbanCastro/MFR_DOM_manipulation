Use the dog API to recreate this webpage for runners but with dogs
- Dog API for all dogs: https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all
- Dog API for all dogs images: https://dog.ceo/api/breed/hound/images

The dog APIS are separated, you can instead, try to list the names and imgs from the same API
From the Harry Potter API: https://hp-api-marcosmarp.herokuapp.com/api/characters
